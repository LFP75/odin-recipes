This is my first assignment with ODIN Project. It involves the building of a basic recipe website. 
It is quite simple but it highlights the components of the curriculum thus far.
I was able to create directories,headings, ordered and unordered lists, link different pages to the index page etc.
It was also a chance to practice basic git commands.
Hopefully, further down in the practice, I will come back and make it more fancy!
